# Word On the Street. My Intrinio web app.
My second attempt to build a stock searching web app. My third attempt to build a web app in general.

#The Thought Process

My first attempt utilized the Alpha Vantage API, however, it wasn't as in depth as I would have liked it to be. Enter Intrinio. 

My initial <a href="https://wireframe.cc/26Kuge">wireframe</a> was meant for a fitness app that used YouTube's and Amazon's 
API, but I changed my mind to build a stock searching web application instead. (Because, finance geek, haha.)

I decided I would keep the overall idea of my wireframe and change the colors to greys and teals after doing a quick search
involving color theory. Blues, greens, and greys go well with the finance industry. I decided to use teal to mix the blue and green, and throw a grey header at the bottom to make the look of the app complete.

I built this using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6) and jQuery. I used three different endpoints for my API.

#Use Cases

This is an informational app about publicly traded companies. A user will search their favorite company, the app will find the matching stock ticker, then provide the latest pricing information, and a few major headlines concerning that company. Why is this app useful? It's made with the novice investor in mind. It gives a small snippet of pricing information that won't overwhelm the user. The news feed also gives the investor an idea of the news surrounding the company; this could potentially impact the users decision to do more research into the company and determine whether or not they would like to invest.
